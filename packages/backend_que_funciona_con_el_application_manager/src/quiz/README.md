## Quiz Module

Students can do quizzes. **IMPORTANT**: The attempts are not graded/stored on the database. Quizzes are purely a way of self-assessment. However, there is an endpoint to store the NUMBER of attempts, purely for statistical purposes.

They belong to one or more courses. They have questions, and each question has a set of answers.

They are created using excel files. The excel file is uploaded, and the system parses it and creates the quiz.
