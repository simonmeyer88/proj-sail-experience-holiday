# Payments module

This is pretty simple. We load payments from external sources (like Stripe in the past, only Woocommerce right now) and store them in the database, associated to users ALWAYS.

Those payments can be seen by managers.

Manual payments can also be created manually (including 'CASH' payments).

Payments can also be deleted.
